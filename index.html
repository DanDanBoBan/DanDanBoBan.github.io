          Using Unreal Blueprint, we explored how we might encourage players to
          leverage different aspects of the environment in order to gain an
          advantage over their enemies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our first pass involved tall-grass volumes that players could hide in
          in order to toggle their visibility to the enemy. This was fine, but
          made for very obvious jack-in-the-box locations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The stealth element really began to shine when we gave players players
          an opportunity to be more expressive with their sneaking. We allowed
          them to hide themselves against low-cover and behind corners in order
          to toggle their visibility from opponents on the opposite side of
          their cover. This allowed them to stay hidden as they moved and pick
          the angles that would protect them from damage.

        I was able to quickly whip up a bunch of new characters for the
        aforementioned MOBA by quickly scripting new abilities for them using
        Unreal Blueprint. The modular, component-based nature of their
        construction made it easy to try out new kits that recombined features
        from other characters. For example, we were quickly able to throw
        together a burst-fire cone-damage sword attack by using components from
        our brawler and SMG characters.

          There was a really complex stretch at the beginning of Fuser where we
          were trying develop a prototype that had the potential to be released
          on a variety of platforms. We wanted to take the amazing music-mashing
          technology that Harmonix’s engineers had developed for DropMix and
          demonstrate it’s potential on Consoles and PC. We had to take the act
          of grabbing a disc and smacking it onto a turntable feel satisfying in
          VR, on a gamepad, and when using a keyboard/mouse. We ended up using a
          virtual ‘hand’ that could be driven by whatever input device the
          player was using.

          Once the contract had been signed and the project entered production,

        managed to rig up much of the scoreboard system using kismet. It was

        with a graybox level. On each level I focused on the expected theme for
        the paths that players would be taking throughout the space. For
        example, in some levels they would be following a shallow up-and-down
        pattern. In others, they would be diving into deep trenches and then
        battling their way back up.
