        Project Oscar was a tactical brawler reminiscent of a MOBA. The client
        had soft-launched a real-time tactics project and found it was not
        meeting its financial potential. Demiurge was tasked with taking over
        the project and making it more profitable.
      </p>
      <p>
        My work on the project focused largely on using Unreal Blueprint to
        stand up potential features in order quickly decide whether they were
        worth pursuing further.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="projectOscarChallengeStrike">
      <div id="projectOscarChallengeStrikeProblemDescContent">
        The first easy win that we wanted to pursue was playing with map size
        and layout. Unfortunately, most of the game's systems assumed that
        levels would be User-Generated, and built within a strict ruleset.
        Efforts to try new level layouts required saving and retrieving data on
        some external server. Our rapid prototyping phase was not as rapid as we
        needed it to be.
      </div>
      <div id="projectOscarChallengeStrikeWorkDescContent">
        After a few sprints of slow progress, I pitched the idea of spinning off
        a small prototyping strike team. This strike team would take some time
        experimenting with new moment-to-moment gameplay mechanics that might
        keep players engaged.
      </div>
      <div id="projectOscarChallengeStrikeResultDescContent">
        This is the result of that
      </div>
    </div>
    <div id="projectOscarChallengeStealthProblemDescContent">
      <p>
        Using Unreal Blueprint, we explored how we might encourage players to
        leverage different aspects of the environment in order to gain an
        advantage over their enemies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our first pass involved tall-grass volumes that players could hide in in
        order to toggle their visibility to the enemy. This was fine, but made
        for very obvious jack-in-the-box locations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The stealth element really began to shine when we gave players players
        an opportunity to be more expressive with their sneaking. We allowed
        them to hide themselves against low-cover and behind corners in order to
        toggle their visibility from opponents on the opposite side of their
        cover. This allowed them to stay hidden as they moved and pick the
        angles that would protect them from damage.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="projectOscarChallengeKitsProblemDescContent">
      <p>
        I was able to quickly whip up a bunch of new characters for the
        aforementioned MOBA by quickly scripting new abilities for them using
        Unreal Blueprint. The modular, component-based nature of their
        construction made it easy to try out new kits that recombined features
        from other characters. For example, we were quickly able to throw
        together a burst-fire cone-damage sword attack by using components from
        our brawler and SMG characters.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="projectFoxtrotDescContent">
      <p>
        Project Foxtrot was a music game that helped users create and share
        user-generated content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of the work that I did involved the around-game menus and
        play-session flow. I focused my efforts on developing workflows and
        assets that made the screen-building process faster and less
        error-prone.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="projectFoxtrotChallengeActionProblemDescContent">
      <p>
        I wanted to try to consolidate the behaviors of common input actions
        across multiple screens. I implemented a system that utilized an
        abstracted layer of input assets that defined common behaviors for
        actions such as "Delete List Item". These assets helped a screen know
        which input events to listen for, and how to react to these changes in
        input state. In the "Delete List Item" example, the screens would know
        to use the appropriate glyph on each screen, and would always trigger on
        the appropriate input state change.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="projectFoxtrotChallengeContextProblemDescContent">
      <p>
        I wanted to reduce the amount of conditional checking that needed to be
        made during each input event. For example, if a screen featured multiple
        lists that could be navigated, I didn't want to have to check which list
        was highlighted when deciding which item to activate. Checking at the
        time of input not only required a great deal of corner-cases, but it
        also required any new scripters to have complete knowledge of what
        states they might need to check for.
      </p>
      <p>
        To get around this, I developed a "nested input context stack". For
        example, in a screen with multiple lists, each list would be its own
        input context that could be nested within the context of the screen as a
        whole. When the list was highlighted, it would add itself to the stack
        and vice versa. Furthermore, when a popup was placed on the stack and
        blocked input from the context of the screen below, it would also block
        input to the list nested within the screen.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="projectFoxtrotChallengeStylingProblemDescContent">
      We wanted to make it easier to consistently stylize widgets used in
      various screns. For example, when an artists placed a text box, we didn't
      want them to have to copy-paste all of the settings from text field to
      text field. To avoid this problem, we created a "stylized text" widget
      blueprint upon which an author could choose from a set of artist-defined
      "text style" data assets. When the author chose a style, the properties
      defined in the data asset were automatically applied to the widgets
      within.
    </div>
    <!--
    <div id="projectFoxtrotChallengeInputProblemDescContent">
      There were a couple of rough edges in Fuser's menu input routing that I
      wanted to avoid in the next project. I wanted to find a better way to
      route input that didn't rely on a big if/else statement in the
      on-button-down function. I also wanted to consolidate the way common
      actions were processed in various screens.
    </div>
    <div id="projectFoxtrotChallengeInputWorkDescContent">
      To solve this, I created data assets that acted as an abstraction of the
      different input actions that were shared across screens. These data assets
      contained information such as the input actions that the screens were
      listening for changes in.
    </div>
    <div id="projectFoxtrotChallengeInputResultDescContent">
      These data assets allowed us to reference action assets from any screen
      with the assurance that the screens would react to them consistently.

      When the player visited the vendor, we showed them the Shop Screen. It

      Most of the work I did on Sunset Overdrive involved data plumbing and

      ensuring that the leaderboards worked.

      Bug Hunt is a wave-based, co-op PvE mode released for Aliens: Colonial

      enemy wave composition in the map “Tribute”. When the engineers were
      swamped, I used Excel to smooth out some of the edges in the scripting
      process to improve the workflow for the design team.

      I worked as a designer on the team that put together Mass Effect: Pinnacle

      head around the Unreal's Kismet scripting system. Whipping up prototypes
      for each game mode ended up being a total blast. I also managed to rig up
      much of the scoreboard system using kismet. It was cool getting to kick
      around in BioWare's conversation tools, which I used to set up the mission
      selection conversation.

      The level design work that I did on Shoot Many Robots was primarily
      focused on the survival missions. These missions were wave-based, PvE
      arena battles for a side-scrolling shoot-em-up. I started each level with
      a graybox level. On each level I focused on the expected theme for the
      paths that players would be taking throughout the space. For example, in
      some levels they would be following a shallow up-and-down pattern. In
      others, they would be diving into deep trenches and then battling their
      way back up.

    <div id="FuserMainProblemDescContent">
      The main menu was a great example of our live data-fetching work. When
      players opened the menu, the game would ask the server for any promotions
      and featured mixes which could be displayed once the information was
      received. The art team was critical in making sure we were accounting for
      all of the different states that a panel's skeleton would require and they
      came up with a great visual language for each of those states. These
      states included things like "fetching data", "fetch failed" and "no data
      found".
    </div>
    <div id="FuserSettingsProblemDescContent">
      For some reason, finding good ways to organize settings data and widgets
      is super satisfying for me. Each of the widget blueprints just treats its

      appropriate settings accordingly.

      way that not only allows enemies to fire from an elevated position, but
