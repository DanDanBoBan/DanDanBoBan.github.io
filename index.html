      <p>
        Using Unreal Blueprint, we explored how we might encourage players to
        leverage different aspects of the environment in order to gain an
        advantage over their enemies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our first pass involved tall-grass volumes that players could hide in in
        order to toggle their visibility to the enemy. This was fine, but made
        for very obvious jack-in-the-box locations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The stealth element really began to shine when we gave players players
        an opportunity to be more expressive with their sneaking. We allowed
        them to hide themselves against low-cover and behind corners in order to
        toggle their visibility from opponents on the opposite side of their
        cover. This allowed them to stay hidden as they moved and pick the
        angles that would protect them from damage.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="projectOceanKitsSummary">
      I was able to quickly whip up a bunch of new characters for the
      aforementioned MOBA by quickly scripting new abilities for them using
      Unreal Blueprint. The modular, component-based nature of their
      construction made it easy to try out new kits that recombined features
      from other characters. For example, we were quickly able to throw together
      a burst-fire cone-damage sword attack by using components from our brawler
      and SMG characters.
    </div>
    <div id="projectCatSummary">
      <p>
        This was mostly focused on ushering properties from data objects into
        the correct widgets in the menus using the Unreal Motion Graphics tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was particularly proud of the work I did to work I did to consolidate
        input functionality into data assets in order to make input scripting
        more consistent.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="projectFuserSummary">
      <p>
        There was a really complex stretch at the beginning of Fuser where we
        were trying develop a prototype that had the potential to be released on
        a variety of platforms. We wanted to take the amazing music-mashing
        technology that Harmonix’s engineers had developed for DropMix and
        demonstrate it’s potential on Consoles and PC. We had to take the act of
        grabbing a disc and smacking it onto a turntable feel satisfying in VR,
        on a gamepad, and when using a keyboard/mouse. We ended up using a
        virtual ‘hand’ that could be driven by whatever input device the player
        was using.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the contract had been signed and the project entered production, I
        helped with UI scripting - mostly surrounding populating text fields and
        images with the appropriate data.

      This was a fun exercise in figuring out how to place information panels in

      Most of the work I did on Sunset Overdrive involved data plumbing and

      ensuring that the leaderboards worked.

      Bug Hunt is a wave-based, co-op PvE mode released for Aliens: Colonial
      Marines. By the time I was brought onto the project, most of the level
      layout was nearing completion. Most of the work I did involved scripting
      enemy wave composition in the map “Tribute”. When the engineers were
      swamped, I used Excel to smooth out some of the edges in the scripting
      process to improve the workflow for the design team.

    <div id="projectStationSummary">
      I worked as a designer on the team that put together Mass Effect: Pinnacle
      Station. The project provided a bunch of awesome opportunities to wrap my
      head around the Unreal's Kismet scripting system. Whipping up prototypes
      for each game mode ended up being a total blast. I also managed to rig up
      much of the scoreboard system using kismet. It was cool getting to kick
      around in BioWare's conversation tools, which I used to set up the mission
      selection conversation.
    </div>
    <div id="projectSmr">
      The level design work that I did on Shoot Many Robots was primarily
      focused on the survival missions. These missions were wave-based, PvE
      arena battles for a side-scrolling shoot-em-up. I started each level with
      a graybox level. On each level I focused on the expected theme for the
      paths that players would be taking throughout the space. For example, in
      some levels they would be following a shallow up-and-down pattern. In
      others, they would be diving into deep trenches and then battling their
      way back up.

      The Crate Creation Screen is where the player would build a loadout of the

      screen features a good example of a tab list. I did a bunch of work to
      make it easier for artists and scripters to change those on the fly in a
      consistent and human-error-resistant way. I did most of the scripting on

      The first survival mission that I worked on, 'Farmland Siege' also ended
      up being my favorite. It has two nice bowl-shaped arenas on either side of

      way that not only allows enemies to fire from an elevated position, but
      also gives the map a nice figure-eight path. Once the first blockout was

      'Cliffs Survival' makes a little more use of vertical space. Stationary

      surges of melee enemies from below chase the players up and out. After an
